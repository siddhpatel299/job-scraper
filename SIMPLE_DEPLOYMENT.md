# üöÄ Simple Deployment Guide (Fixed)

The build error you saw happens because Railway is trying to build both Python and Node.js together. Here's a simpler approach:

## Option 1: Python Backend Only (Recommended)

Deploy just the Python backend to Railway, and serve the job search functionality through the existing Flask templates.

### Steps:

1. **Push current changes to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment config"
git push origin main
```

2. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) 
   - Create new project from GitHub repo
   - Railway will now only build the Python backend
   - Your app will be available at `https://your-app.railway.app`

3. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway:
   - `FLASK_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=8000` (Railway sets this automatically)

## Option 2: Split Architecture (Advanced)

If you want the modern Next.js frontend:

### Backend (Railway):
- Deploy Python backend as API
- Use the files I created (Procfile, nixpacks.toml, etc.)

### Frontend (Vercel):
```bash
cd next-app
npx vercel
```
Then update the API endpoints in Next.js to point to your Railway backend URL.

## Current Status

‚úÖ Python backend ready for deployment  
‚úÖ Deployment configs fixed  
‚úÖ Environment variables configured  
‚ö†Ô∏è  Next.js frontend can be deployed separately if needed  

## What You Get

Your deployed app will have:
- ‚úÖ Job search functionality
- ‚úÖ All 6+ job sources (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.)
- ‚úÖ 12-hour time filter (that we just added!)
- ‚úÖ Cybersecurity & Software Engineering categories
- ‚úÖ Export features (PDF, CSV)
- ‚úÖ Professional web interface

## Try It Now

The simplest path is to deploy just the Python backend to Railway. You'll get a fully functional job scraper with a web interface at your Railway URL!

**Ready to deploy? The configuration is now fixed and should work without the npm/Node.js build errors.**
